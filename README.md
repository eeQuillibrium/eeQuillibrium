### About
In high school I enjoyed creating website layouts and writing scripts in js.

In college, I started studying functional programming, algorithms, object-oriented programming, combinatorial schemes, refactoring, testing and other things that strengthened my fundamental knowledge of programming.

Since 2023, I have discovered Golang and began to be interested in backend development.

Here, I am sharing some of my (sometimes not completely finished) projects on Go.
